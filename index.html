        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://a.co/d/j7SvjJz" class="book-title-link">The Naked Truth</a></h3>
        <p>Jane Cullen’s journalism assignment was simple: Write a report about Paradise Cove. The catch? It’s a nudist
          resort. And somehow, that turns out to be the least surprising part of her story.</p>
        <p>Under the guidance of Bill, the resort’s irrepressibly optimistic owner, and a colorful community of free
          spirits, philosophers, and found family, Jane begins to question everything she thought she knew about
          herself. As she navigates from nervous reporter to unlikely art director, she learns that true liberation
          isn’t about taking your clothes off – it’s about deciding who you want to become.</p>
        <p>Set on a whimsical tropical island where dress codes are nonexistent but life lessons are abundant, The Naked
          Truth is a wholesome, warm, and witty celebration of self-creation. Through Jane’s journey, we discover that
          maybe we’re all just one leap of faith away from becoming who we’re meant to be – even if that leap happens to
          be from a rooftop, wearing nothing but a smile and a safety harness.</p>

        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://a.co/d/7AmlyH7" class="book-title-link">The Ocean’s Daughter</a></h3>
        <p>
          Jane thought she’d found her place in the world. Then she lost it.</p>
        <p>When a faceless investment firm buys Paradise Cove and converts it to a textile resort, Jane loses her job,
          her home, and the community that taught her who she was. But an unexpected opportunity thrusts her into a new
          role leading an organization dedicated to spreading naturism globally. She’s nineteen. She’s not ready. And
          thanks to an online smear campaign, half the internet has opinions about her body and her choices.</p>
        <p>Enter Kat, a mysterious artist who answered an ad Jane forgot she posted, and who sees through every wall
          Jane has built. As Jane navigates a hostile world, corporate indifference, and her own spiraling self-doubt,
          she discovers that the hardest person to liberate might be herself.</p>
